# Standardize (informational) files  
  
To help others understand the project, the contribution guidelines and code of conduct at least add the following files:  
  
1. **README.md** - Contains information about the project, installing and basic usage. If you have a lot of documentation consider using `docsify` to manage this documentation and publish it to GitHub pages.  
2. **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Guideline how to contribute to the project.  
3. **CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md** - A code of conduct is a set of rules outlining the social norms, responsibilities of, and or proper practices for, an individual, contributing to the project. In its 2007 International Good Practice Guidance, "Defining and Developing an Effective Code of Conduct for Organizations", the International Federation of Accountants provided the following working definition: : "Principles, values, standards, or rules of behaviour that guide the decisions, procedures and systems of an organization in a way that contributes to the welfare of its key stakeholders, and respects the rights of all constituents affected by its operations."
4. **LICENSE.md** - The license the project is released under. Very important for people that want to use your project. For more information about open source license types, checkout this [website](https://choosealicense.com/). Also checkout [GitHub licensing information](https://help.github.com/articles/licensing-a-repository/) about choosing the right license for your repository. It also contains the license keywords you can use in the `package.json` file.  
5. **[EditorConfig](http://EditorConfig.org)** - Standardize a consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs.
