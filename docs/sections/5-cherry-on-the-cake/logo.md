# Project logo

Want your repo to look professional and cool? Add a logo and some badges! But don't over do it :-)

Add the following to the `README.md` file to add a centered image to the top of the `READEME.md` file.

```html
<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/vue-build-helper-robot.gif" alt="vue-build-helper robot" width="200"/>
</p>
```

So it is possible to add raw HTML to the markdown file. This will look for an image that is in the `images` directory relative to the directory the `README.md` file is located in. It also sets the width of the image to 200 pixels. Nice :-)
