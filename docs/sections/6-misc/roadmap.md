# Roadmap

What's next?

 - [ ] Checkout [The Good Parts](https://github.com/dwyl/goodparts), an ESLint Plugin that only allows JavaScript the Good Parts (and "Better Parts") in your code so you can ship more reliable code.
 - [ ] ~~Continuous Integration (CI) and~~ Continuous Deployment (CD).
 - [ ] CLI demo generated with [svg-term-cli](https://github.com/marionebl/svg-term-cli).
 - [ ] Add babel instructions.
 - [ ] Multi repository setup with [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/).
 - [ ] [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) is a developer-first solution that automates finding & fixing vulnerabilities in dependencies.
 - [x] Change format of this repo to [docsify](https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify). docsify is a magical documentation site generator. It will make maintaining this document much easier. Also add it as a component to Setting Up an Open Source Repository.
 - [x] [Bili](https://github.com/egoist/bili) is a zero-config library bundler that uses [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup) under the hood. A module bundler compiles small pieces of code into something larger and more complex, such as a library or application.
 - [x] [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to test and deploy with confidence. Easily sync your GitHub projects with Travis CI and youâ€™ll be testing your code in minutes!
 - [x] [Greenkeeper](https://greenkeeper.io) sits between npm and GitHub, observing all of the modules you depend on. When they get updated, your project gets a new branch with that update. Your CI tests kick in, and we watch them to see whether they pass.
 - [x] Add [Prettier](https://prettier.io) with support for Vue standard.
 - [x] Add eslint instructions.
 - [x] Add jest instructions.
 - [x] Generating documentation using [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/)) instructions.
 - [x] Writing this guide I ran into [Release It!](https://github.com/webpro/release-it). Release It! automates the tedious tasks of software releases. It looks like a very promising tool that supports a lot of features out of the box including Conventional Commits and Semantic Versioning. It supports a lot of tools described in this document. Investigate using this as integrated solution instead of using all the tools separately.
 - [x] O my, ran into another complete software release solution: [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release), a fully automated version management and package publishing tool. Looks a lot like Release It. Which one to use?
