# Motivation

Automation, early feedback and understanding how the different tooling actually works are the most important drivers for setting up this document. Of course I could have ran some template to generate a project or copy a project from GitHub or where ever, but then I would not really understand the tooling I would be using. This becomes a (big) problem when you a) run into a problem; or b) you want to fine tune the tooling.

In addition I also wanted to start giving back to the Open Source community. There are so many great tools out there that I use everyday on projects. Why not release my code and hope others can profit from it? Anyway one of the things that I notice as I am frequently looking for turnkey solutions to problems, is that there are a lot of repositories that are setup really nicely and they are easy to navigate and use. Others even though the software is great, little attention has been paid to the overall setup, way of working, tooling and documentation. This is a problem for people that would like to use your (brilliant) software, because it is hard to understand it and contribute to it. So this is the result of my journey that is a reference for myself. I hope others profit from it and hopefully contribute to it!

When developing software there are a lot of tedious, repeatable, error-prone, and boring tasks. These should be automated as much as possible, so that there is more time for actual work and also for the interesting things.

I focus on as many aspects of professional and best practices in regards to software development, like:

- Standardizing the workflow so that different steps can be automated.
- Standardizing commit messages so that it is easy for others to contribute and we can automatically generate a changelog and bump version numbers automatically
- Automating static code analysis with the help of linters in order to find coding problems and inconsistencies as early as possible; itâ€™s best to find them at development time and try to fix them automatically.
- Automating code formatting based on a common ruleset.
- Automating the release process so that it is a breeze to push new releases to GitHub and NPM early and often. 
- Automating testing so that adding features, fixing bugs and refactoring can be done with confidence, because it is easy to see if code changes have side effects. In addition tests are also a great way to understand how code works.

It makes it so much easier for others to contribute to a project.
