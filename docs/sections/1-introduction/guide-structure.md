# Guide structure

This document has been structured in such a way that it is in logical order when initially setting up a repository for a new project. However, the document makes it possible to quickly navigate it and find parts that you are interested in when adapting an existing repository. 

I could have chosen to setup a template that could easily be initialized, but that would limit the learning effect. My goal is to help you understand how the different tools work individually and together so that you can configure and fine tune them yourself. Executing the steps yourself makes the learning effect much greater.

Sections
- **Introduction** - This section :-) Explains the why of this guide.
- **Way of working** - Explains the way of working that is the fundament of choices made in this guide.
- **Basics** - What is a repository and how to initialize it and what standard (informational) files should be part of it.
- **Tooling** - The main part which explains how to configure the different tools. I try to keep this as lean as possible and only provide explanation were this is required.
- **Cherry on the cake** - The final piece that give your repository some swung.
- **Miscellaneous** - House keeping stuff.
