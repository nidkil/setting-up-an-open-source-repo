## Welcome!

> This guide describes the steps to setup an (open source) repository based on a recommended workflow. The goal is to professionalize and standardize the way of working and were possible automate and enforce this.

Of course it can also be used for closed source repositories, as any development team can benefit from these principles.

I wrote this document when I was setting up my first open source repositories, because there was a lot to learn, which cost a lot of effort. All the information is out there, but it is not conveniently in one place, often outdated or to much or to little information to get a good understanding. I wanted to document this for myself and decided to share it with others so that they can profit from my effort.

This is a living document. I will continue to add to this document as needed and enhance it where needed.

Enjoy!
